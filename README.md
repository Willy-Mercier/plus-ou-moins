# plus-ou-moins

This game is one of my very first program to learn to code in c++.
The program is written in french.
To understand the rules, they are translated here in english

"The + or - game goes like this: "
"I (the computer) will choose a random number between 0 and 10/100/1000 (it depends on
on the difficulty)"
"Your goal is to guess the number I chose "
"How? "
"You are going to type a number on the computer to try to guess mine, if your number :
"is greater than mine then I will say ""-"""
"is less than mine then I'll tell you "+"""
"-is equal to my number then you win!"
"If you are wrong then you can try to find my number by typing a new number on the keyboard using the clue until you find my number"
